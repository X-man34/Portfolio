<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In this project, we will be implementing three different orientation
algorithms to estimate the orientation of a phone over time. A naïve
gyroscope integration (dead reckoning) algorithm is used in Question 1
and Question 4a. The Mahony filter is used in Questions 2 and 3, and
serves as the baseline for comparison in Question 4. Finally, the TRIAD
method is introduced in Question 4b and compared against the other
methods in Questions 4c and 4d.</p>
<p>The framework of this codebase allows for the easy creation of
different filters termed “estimators”. In <code>filters.py</code> there
is an abstract class called <code>Estimator</code> which can be extended
to implement various filters and estimators. Because of the code
structure, we decided to make some of our own filters as well, so there
are 5 implementations: - Naïve Estimator (required) - Mahony Filter
(required) - TRIAD (Tri-Axial Attitude Determination) Estimator
(required) - Mahony with TRIAD filter (Caleb’s idea) - Hybrid
Mahony-TRIAD filter (Charles’ idea)</p>
<p>These subclasses of <code>Estimator</code> are then initialized and
passed into the <code>simulate_and_visualize_data</code> method in
<code>visualizer</code>. This project structure allows for the rapid
creation and iteration of different filters. Additionally 3D
visualization techniques along with 2D plots were used extensively in
the debugging process.</p>
<h2 id="overview-of-estimators">Overview of Estimators</h2>
<h3 id="naïve-gyroscope-integration-dead-reckoning">Naïve Gyroscope
Integration (Dead Reckoning)</h3>
<p>The naïve gyroscope integration algorithm estimates orientation by
directly integrating the angular velocity over time. It assumes that the
gyroscope data is accurate and doesn’t include any corrections from
other sensors. This method is simple and fast but suffers from drift
over time, especially if there’s any bias or noise in the gyroscope. It
works well in the short term but quickly becomes inaccurate during
longer or more complex motion.</p>
<h3 id="mahony-filter">Mahony Filter</h3>
<p>The Mahony filter is a nonlinear complementary filter that combines
gyroscope integration with landmark innovation using accelerometer and
magnetometer data. It corrects drift and stabilizes orientation over
time by aligning the estimated orientation with gravity (from the
accelerometer) and magnetic north (from the magnetometer). It also
dynamically estimates gyroscope bias. This makes the Mahony filter more
reliable than dead reckoning, especially for longer durations or when
precise orientation is important. It was observed during testing and
debugging that the Mahony filter performs well when things are moving
rapidly but suffers from drift and compounding error when things are
still.</p>
<h3 id="triad-method">TRIAD Method</h3>
<p>The TRIAD (Tri-Axial Attitude Determination) method estimates
orientation using two reference vectors: gravity and magnetic north. It
constructs two orthonormal frames — one from known inertial vectors and
one from measured body-frame vectors — and computes the rotation matrix
that aligns them. Unlike the other two methods, TRIAD is algebraic and
doesn’t rely on time integration, which means it gives an immediate
estimate of orientation at each time step, but doesn’t track changes
over time or handle gyroscope data.</p>
<h3 id="calebs-custom-filter">Caleb’s Custom Filter</h3>
<p>One of the main shortcomings (yet at the same time, its appeal) of
the pure TRIAD method is its non-time dependence. That is, if you just
provide the data at a single instant in time, TRIAD can provide you the
rotation matrix. However this causes the estimator to be jumpy, and skip
all around when that is obviously not how real motion works. Caleb’s
filter attempts to solve this problem by using many aspects of the
Mahony filter, with one key difference. The final result has the same
magnetic correction, quaternion update, and estimation of gravity and
north vectors as the Mahony Filter, but the innovation term
<code>omega_mes</code> is calculated uniquely.</p>
<p><code>omega_mes is calculated as follows</code> A rotation matrix is
created using the TRIAD function. We can use this matrix to write an
equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\hat{R} = AR_{Tr}\]</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(\hat{R}\)</span> is our current
estimate of the rotation matrix, <span
class="math inline">\(R_{Tr}\)</span> is the rotation matrix derived
directly from data using the TRIAD method, and <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is an unknown rotation matrix relating
the two. Solving this we get: <span class="math display">\[A =
\hat{R}R_{Tr}^T\]</span></p>
<p>This rotation matrix <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> can be
thought of as the rotation from where TRIAD says we are to where all our
previous estimations (a combination of TRIAD and Mahony stuff) says we
are. Then we can turn this rotation <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> into a angular velocity by representing
it as an axis-angle and computing <span
class="math inline">\(\theta\hat{k}\)</span>. This innovation term is
then multiplied by a gain and subtracted from the gyroscope data
yielding: <span class="math display">\[\omega_{mes}=\omega_{y} -
k_{p}(\theta\hat{k})\]</span></p>
<p>This <span class="math inline">\(\omega_{mes}\)</span> is used just
like it is in the Mahony filter. This filter succeeds at removing the
jerkiness of the pure TRIAD estimator and shines where TRIAD is best,
not drifting and remaining accurate for long periods of time. However it
falls short when things start moving fast.</p>
<h3 id="charles-custom-filter">Charles’ Custom Filter</h3>
<p>Charles’ filter is a variant of Caleb’s filter and combines the
Mahony and Mahony-TRIAD filters into a hybrid. The goal is to use the
best filter for the task at hand. TRIAD is used then things are
relatively still and Mahony when there is movement. This is accomplished
by computing the magnitude of the angular velocity data and comparing it
to a predefined threshold like .1. If the value is greater than that, a
plain Mahony filter is used but if its lower then the Modified Mahony
Filter is used, utilizing the TRIAD method to compute the innovation as
described above. This has good results and works as intended.</p>
<h2 id="question-1">Question 1</h2>
<p>In question 1 we implement a naïve gyroscope integration in order to
estimate orientation with a set of given inputs. These inputs simulate
perfect gyroscope data with no bias or drift.</p>
<p>The given inputs can be represented by various rotation matrixes.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><span class="math inline">\(R_{x,\frac{\pi}{4}}\)</span> - Rotate
about the <strong>x-axis</strong> by <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{\pi}{4}\)</span> radians<br />
</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(R_{z,\frac{\pi}{4}}\)</span> - Rotate
about the <strong>z-axis</strong> by <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{\pi}{4}\)</span> radians<br />
</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(R_{x,-\frac{\pi}{4}}\)</span> - Rotate
about the <strong>x-axis</strong> by <span
class="math inline">\(-\frac{\pi}{4}\)</span> radians<br />
</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(R_{z,-\frac{\pi}{4}}\)</span> - Rotate
about the <strong>z-axis</strong> by <span
class="math inline">\(-\frac{\pi}{4}\)</span> radians</li>
</ol>
<p>If we multiply all these rotation matrices we can see our expected
result:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(R_{x,\frac{\pi}{4}} R_{z,\frac{\pi}{4}}
R_{x,-\frac{\pi}{4}} R_{z,-\frac{\pi}{4}} = \begin{bmatrix}
0.8536 &amp; 0.1464 &amp; -0.5000 \\
-0.2500 &amp; 0.9571 &amp; -0.1464 \\
0.4571 &amp; 0.2500 &amp; 0.8536
\end{bmatrix}\)</span></p>
<p>Which corresponds with this quaternion:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(q_{final}=0.9571 &lt;  0.1036, -0.2500,
-0.1036 &gt;\)</span></p>
<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p><span class="math inline">\(q(1)=0.9571 &lt;  0.1036, -0.2500,
-0.1036 &gt;\)</span></p>
<p>We simulated this rotation over time and obtained the exact same
final orientation as expected from the matrix multiplication. This
verifies that our implementation of quaternion integration is correct.
You can see a visualization of this rotation in Fig. 1.1 in the fig file
under <code>fig\Fig 1-1.mp4</code>.</p>
<h3 id="does-it-hold-that-q0-q1">Does it hold that <span
class="math inline">\(q(0) = q(1)\)</span>?</h3>
<p>No, it does not hold that <span class="math inline">\(q(0) =
q(1)\)</span>. We can see from our results that:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(q(0)=1 &lt;  0, 0, 0 &gt;\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(q(1)=0.9571 &lt;  0.1036, -0.2500,
-0.1036 &gt;\)</span></p>
<p>This also makes conceptual sense because rotations in 3D space are
not commutative.</p>
<h2 id="question-2-mahony-filter-implementation">Question 2: Mahony
Filter Implementation</h2>
<p>In question 2 we implement a Mahony filter to estimate a phone’s
orientation over time with a given csv file containing gyroscope,
accelerometer, and magnetometer data over time. The motion consists of a
phone that is still for a few seconds, and is then picked up and rotated
around randomly, but slowly and smoothly, and then set back down.</p>
<p>We tuned out K values to be the following based on trial and
error.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(k_p=1, k_I=.3, k_a=.8,
k_m=.2\)</span></p>
<p>We visualized this motion using MuJoCo that can be seen in
<code>fig\Fig_2-2.mp4</code></p>
<h3 id="results-1">Results</h3>
<p>To calculate the rotation angle over time, we convert the estimated
orientation quaternion at each time step into an axis-angle
representation. We then extract the angle component and plot it with
respect to time.</p>
<p>Figures 2-1a and 2-1b below show the rotation angle over time in
radians and degrees, respectively. The phone remains still at the
beginning, is then slowly rotated in multiple directions, and eventually
returns to rest.</p>
<p>Over the course of the motion, the phone rotated a total of
approximately 8,572 radians, or 491,165 degrees. This total includes all
incremental rotations.</p>

<em>Fig 2-1b: Mahony Estimated rotation angle over time
(degrees)</em></p>
<h3 id="observations">Observations</h3>
<p>While working on this project, we noticed several behaviors of the
Mahony filter:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When the magnetometer gain <span
class="math inline">\(k_m\)</span> was set too high, the phone’s
orientation estimate became overly constrained. Specifically, during
large flips, the filter would only allow the phone to rotate about 90
degrees, even when the phone was flipped fully. This prevented full
rotations and caused the phone to align too strongly with magnetic
north.</p></li>
<li><p>The filter showed a tendency to drift toward magnetic north very
slowly. For low values of <span class="math inline">\(k_m\)</span>, the
phone would gradually oscillate around magnetic north until it converged
on the correct orientation. For larger values of <span
class="math inline">\(k_m\)</span>, it would snap into place much more
quickly. We discovered this when testing with our own data, where the
phone was sitting still for a full minute, and we observed the filter
slowly orienting it correctly over time. This behavior occurs because
the initial orientation is assumed to be the identity quaternion, which
does not match the phone’s actual orientation. This led us to consider
using the TRIAD method to initialize the orientation more accurately
before switching to the Mahony filter for continuous updates.</p></li>
<li><p>We verified the correctness of the internal orientation estimate
using 3D visualization in MuJoCo. By observing the rotated magnetic
reference vector <span class="math inline">\(\hat{v}_m\)</span>, we saw
that it remained fixed in the <strong>spatial</strong> (inertial) frame
as expected. This confirmed that the estimated orientation was rotating
the internal reference vectors correctly.</p></li>
<li><p>To further test the filter’s sensitivity, we placed a magnet near
the phone. In the 3D visualization, we observed a clear reaction in the
filter’s output — the orientation estimate became unstable or skewed.
This confirmed that the magnetometer data was being used actively and
was susceptible to external magnetic disturbances.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="question-3">Question 3</h2>
<p>In Question 3, we used the Mahony filter developed in Question 2 to
process IMU data collected from our own phone. We extracted gyroscope,
accelerometer, and magnetometer data and exported it as a CSV file. The
phone was able to sample data at approximately 100 Hz. While each sensor
had its own timestamp, the sampling intervals were sufficiently close
that we used the accelerometer timestamps as a common reference across
all measurements.</p>
<p>We used <code>charlie_phone_540.csv</code> as the input dataset to
the filter. In this dataset, the phone was rotated a total of 540
degrees: first 180° about the phone’s z-axis, then 180° about the
y-axis, and finally 180° about the x-axis. A video showing the filter’s
visualization of this sequence is included in
<code>fig/Fig_3-1.mp4</code>.</p>
<h3 id="results-2">Results</h3>
<h4 id="a-roll-pitch-yaw-vs.-time">(a) Roll, Pitch, Yaw vs. Time</h4>
<p>We computed the roll, pitch, and yaw angles by converting the
estimated orientation quaternion from the Mahony filter into Euler
angles. These angles were then plotted with respect to time.</p>
<p><img src="fig/Fig_3-2.png" alt="Figure 3-2" /> <em>Fig 3-2: Roll,
Pitch, Yaw vs Time</em></p>
<p>The plot confirms the intended motion sequence. Initially, we observe
a rotation about the z-axis (yaw), followed by rotation about the y-axis
(pitch), and finally about the x-axis (roll), consistent with the
phone’s movement.</p>
<h4 id="b-estimated-error-vs.-time">(b) Estimated Error vs. Time</h4>
<p>To estimate the Mahony filter’s error signal, we used the formula
given in Equation (6):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
E_{\text{mes}} = 1 - \mathbf{v}_a \cdot \hat{\mathbf{v}}_a + 1 -
\mathbf{v}_m \cdot \hat{\mathbf{v}}_m
\]</span></p>
<p>This error metric captures the disagreement between the measured
sensor directions and the expected directions from the current
orientation estimate.</p>
<p><img src="fig/Fig_3-3.png" alt="Figure 3-3" /> <em>Fig 3-3: Estimated
Error vs Time</em></p>
<p>The error peaks during periods of rapid motion, as expected. When the
phone is still, the orientation estimate converges, and the error
reduces.</p>
<h4 id="c-gyroscope-bias-estimate-vs.-time">(c) Gyroscope Bias Estimate
vs. Time</h4>
<p>The Mahony filter also maintains an internal estimate of the
gyroscope bias, which is updated over time to account for sensor drift.
We recorded and plotted this bias estimate.</p>
<p><img src="fig/Fig_3-4.png" alt="Figure 3-4" /><br />
<em>Fig 3-4: Estimated Gyroscope Bias vs Time</em></p>
<p>The bias estimate increases during motion as expected.</p>
<h2 id="question-4">Question 4</h2>
<p>Question 4 focuses on the implementation of the TRIAD and Naïve
estimators. In part A we are asked to implement the Naïve estimator. Its
implementation can be found in <code>filters.py</code> file in the class
<code>NaiveEstimator(Estimator)</code>. Its is not very complicated and
simply implements a equation given in the project instructions which I
will repeat for clarity: <span
class="math display">\[\mathbf{q}_{k+1}=e^{\frac {1} {2}
\Omega(\omega)\delta t}\mathbf{q}_{k}\]</span> It appears to work
moderately well as ### Results</p>
<h2 id="question-4-1">Question 4</h2>
<p>In Question 4, we implemented two additional orientation estimation
methods: the naïve gyroscope integration method and the TRIAD (Tri-axial
Attitude Determination) method. These estimators were used to compare
against the Mahony filter implemented in previous questions. We
evaluated their performance on the input data from Question 2 as well as
our own phone dataset from Question 3.</p>
<h3 id="a-naïve-gyroscope-integration-method">(a) Naïve Gyroscope
Integration Method</h3>
<p>We implemented the naïve estimator by integrating the raw gyroscope
measurements over time using the same quaternion exponential update
technique from Question 1. This method estimates orientation purely
based on angular velocity, without any correction for drift or sensor
error. It is simple to implement but susceptible to long-term
inaccuracy.</p>
<h3 id="b-triad-tri-axial-attitude-determination-method">(b) TRIAD
(Tri-axial Attitude Determination) Method</h3>
<p>The TRIAD method was implemented using the normalized gravity and
magnetic field vectors as references, and the corresponding
accelerometer and magnetometer readings from the IMU as measurements. At
each time step, we constructed a direction cosine matrix from the triads
and computed the rotation matrix algebraically. This method does not
accumulate error over time, but its accuracy depends heavily on the
quality of the accelerometer and magnetometer readings at each
moment.</p>
<h3 id="results-3">Results</h3>
<h4 id="c-naïve-gyroscope-integration-method-and-triad-method">(c) Naïve
Gyroscope Integration Method and TRIAD Method</h4>
<p>We processed the input file from Question 2 using the naïve gyroscope
integration method and computed the rotation angle <span
class="math inline">\(\theta(t)\)</span> at each time step. This angle
was extracted from the quaternion’s axis-angle representation and
plotted with respect to time.</p>
<p>A video visualization of this method can be seen in
<code>Fig_4-1.mp4</code>.</p>
<p><img src="fig/Fig_4-2.png" alt="Figure 4-2" /><br />
<em>Fig 4-2: Rotation angle over time using the naïve gyroscope
integration method.</em></p>
<p>The rotation angle increases continuously during motion, as expected,
but small integration errors accumulate over time, causing drift. This
method performs well in the short term but is not reliable for long-term
estimation without correction.</p>
<hr />
<p>We then processed the same dataset using the TRIAD method and plotted
the estimated rotation angle over time.</p>
<p>A video visualization is available in <code>Fig_4-3.mp4</code>.</p>
<p><img src="fig/Fig_4-4.png" alt="Figure 4-4" /><br />

but is more sensitive to noise in the magnetometer and accelerometer.
Sudden spikes or jitter appear in the plot if either sensor experiences
interference or measurement error. The method remains stable over time
due to the lack of integration drift.</p>

Roll, Pitch, Yaw and Error Estimation — Naïve and TRIAD Methods</h4>
<p>We used the same dataset from Question 3,
<code>charlie_phone_540.csv</code>, as the input for both the naïve
estimator and the TRIAD method. In this dataset, the phone undergoes a
sequence of three 180° rotations: first about the phone’s z-axis (yaw),
then about the y-axis (pitch), and finally about the x-axis (roll).</p>
<p>Below are the roll, pitch, and yaw angles computed from each
estimator, as well as the corresponding error estimates using the error
formula:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
E_{\text{mes}} = 1 - \mathbf{v}_a \cdot \hat{\mathbf{v}}_a + 1 -
\mathbf{v}_m \cdot \hat{\mathbf{v}}_m
\]</span></p>

<p>The naïve method showed clear yaw, pitch, then roll movements as
expected, but the TRIAD filter failed at accurately capturing this
sequential motion. This behavior is clearly visible in the visualization
videos:<code>Fig_4-6a.mp4</code> for the naïve method and
<code>Fig_4-6b.mp4</code> for the TRIAD method.</p>
<h4 id="e">(e)</h4>
<p>Our mahony filter has problems with drifting when the IMU is still
and keeping up with the phone when its flipped around quickly. The TRIAD
filter on the other hand works best when nothing is moving. Over long
datasets, despite being grounded with the gravity and north vector’s the
Mahony filters drift seems to do it a disservice while the TRIAD filter
doesn’t suffer from this issue. However when it comes to fast movements,
the TRIAD filter almost looks random, it jerks all over and is basically
useless. The dataset you provided has a lot of motion in it and the
Mahony filter is probably the best for it, but if the phone were in a
car on a long road trip, or even a normal drive, the TRIAD filter would
probably be the best. The characteristics of the dataset of a phone in a
car would be gravity and magnetometer vectors that hardly change but all
sorts of small random angular velocities. This would mess up the mahony
filter and it would probably be jittery, while the TRIAD filter with its
consistent landmarks would likely be more stable. The Charlie filter
would likly excel in all these scenarios because in the car, the omega
values would be small and thus it always use triad, but maybe if you
were really accelerating, or hit a bump etc, it would switch to mahony.
But with the provided data, it uses mahony for almost the whole time,
but at beginning and end it uses TRIAD. It also sort of grounds the
estimate midway for a few time steps during the fast (relatively fast,
compared to sitting on the table.) movement when the phone slows down or
switches direction.</p>
<p>After writing the prior paragraph, Charles went out in his car and
took some data of normal driving with the phone taped to the dashboard.
He did a bunch of turns and hit a bunch of bumps and ended in the same
place that he started. We then pitted different filters against
eachother in <code>TheOctagon.py</code>. The results: all the
predictions were wrong. The mahony filter beat everything by a long shot
and ended in the same spot. The triad filter just twitched and didn’t
respond to any of the mag data, so it was probably interfered with. The
Naïve filter just Naïvely spun around and got lost.</p>
