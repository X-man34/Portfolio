      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6 text-lg">FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) is the middle school division of the FIRST robotics organization, where students design and build robots within an 18” x 18” x 18” footprint using extruded aluminum beams and a variety of kit components. These robots require a high level of hands-on skill and are ideally designed in CAD prior to fabrication.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6 text-lg">Participating in FTC provided me with a strong foundation in essential engineering principles, including effective brainstorming, translating ideas into functional designs through CAD, and delegating tasks within a team to meet project goals. During my two years on Team 11109 Pirate Tekerz, I received one-on-one mentorship and CAD training from a professional engineer and was responsible for the majority of the team’s CAD work. In addition to design, I contributed to fabrication testing and served on the drive team.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6 text-lg">The second year on the team was greatly impacted by COVID-19, which required us to adapt and find ways to build the robot remotely. To address this challenge, I designed the robot to be modular and developed a detailed CAD model, accompanied by comprehensive drawings. These were distributed to team members along with the necessary materials. Each subassembly was built individually before being assembled by a designated member. Remarkably, nearly everything fit and functioned as intended from the start, exceeding my expectations. After fine-tuning, the robot was competition-ready, and we advanced to state for the first time in the team’s history.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6 text-lg">Overall, this experience helped me build a solid grounding in engineering fundamentals, while strengthening my skills in collaboration, design, and fabrication—skills that have served me well and continue to support my growth throughout my college career.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6 text-lg">Below, you’ll find various documents and photos from my time on the team, along with the CAD models and drawings I created.</p>
